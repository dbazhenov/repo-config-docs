# Percona Software Repositories Documentation

Percona provides `apt` and `yum` package repositories of its
[software](https://www.percona.com/software/) for all supported Linux
distributions.

Located at [https://repo.percona.com/](https://repo.percona.com/), these contain
binary and source packages of the latest official product releases as well as
dedicated repositories for testing and experimental builds.

To simplify the process of subscribing to these repositories, we recommend using
the `percona-release` tool. To get started, first [install](installing.md)
`percona-release` on the target system.

Next, [run `percona-release`](percona-release.md) to enable and configure the
desired [Percona software repositories](repository-location.md).

For information about supported OS platforms see [Percona Release Lifecycle
Overview](https://www.percona.com/services/policies/percona-software-support-lifecycle#support).
